## Bringing Down the Cost of Rare Earth Metals

The sources primarily focus on the economic and technological feasibility of asteroid mining for rare metals, with a particular emphasis on platinum-group metals (PGMs). While they don't directly address the impact of bringing down the cost of rare earth metals to near zero on computer design and computational capacity, they provide insights that can help us explore this query.

Abundance Doesn't Guarantee Enriched Design

Even if rare earth metals became incredibly cheap due to successful asteroid mining, it doesn't necessarily mean computers would become far more enriched with these materials to increase their computational capacity. Here's why:

● Material Efficiency: The sources highlight the importance of material efficiency in asteroid mining \[1, 2\]. This principle likely extends to computer manufacturing. Even with abundant and cheap resources, manufacturers would strive to optimize material usage, minimizing waste and production costs.

● Technological Advancements: The sources mention that advancements in technology, such as 3D printing and robotics, could play a significant role in space-based manufacturing \[3\]. These technologies might enable more efficient and precise use of materials, reducing the need for excessive enrichment.

● Alternative Materials: While rare earth metals are crucial for various technologies, ongoing research focuses on finding alternative materials that could offer similar or better performance \[4\]. The abundance of rare earth metals might further accelerate research into these alternatives, potentially leading to designs that rely less on these specific elements.

Computational Capacity is More Than Just Materials

The sources don't specifically address the relationship between rare earth metal content and computational capacity. It's important to recognize that computational capacity is influenced by various factors beyond material composition, including:

● Processor Architecture: The design and complexity of the processor itself play a crucial role in computational power.

● Software Optimization: Efficient software and algorithms can significantly enhance computational performance, even with the same hardware.

● Memory and Storage: Advancements in memory and storage technologies are essential for improving data processing and retrieval speed.

Economic Considerations

While the query focuses on a hypothetical scenario of near-zero cost for rare earth metals, the sources highlight the complex economic considerations surrounding asteroid mining:

● Market Dynamics: Flooding the market with rare earth metals would likely disrupt existing terrestrial mining industries and potentially lead to unpredictable price fluctuations \[5-8\].

● Investment and Return: Asteroid mining requires significant upfront investment and faces long lead times for return on investment \[9, 10\]. Even with abundant resources, the economic viability of such ventures would depend on balancing supply and demand to ensure profitability.

Conclusion

The sources provide a foundation for understanding the potential of asteroid mining and its economic implications. While the impact of near-zero-cost rare earth metals on computer design and computational capacity is not explicitly discussed, the sources suggest that:

● Abundance of materials doesn't guarantee enriched designs due to factors like material efficiency and the pursuit of alternative materials.

● Computational capacity is a complex interplay of various factors, not solely determined by rare earth metal content.

● Economic considerations like market dynamics and return on investment would still influence the feasibility of large-scale asteroid mining and its impact on various industries.

## The Impact of Asteroid Mining on Earth's Weight

While the sources highlight the exciting potential of asteroid mining for obtaining valuable resources, they don't directly address the long-term risk of increased weight on Earth's surface due to bringing back heavy rare metals. However, it's possible to examine this query by considering:

● The scale of potential asteroid mining operations: The sources mention the vastness of resources available in asteroids. For instance, a single 500-meter-wide platinum-rich asteroid could contain nearly 175 times the annual global platinum output \[1\]. However, the sources also acknowledge the immense challenges and costs involved in asteroid mining, suggesting that initial operations would likely be modest in scale \[1-3\].

● The mass of Earth: Earth has an enormous mass of approximately 5.972 × 10^24 kilograms. Even considering the potential for extracting large quantities of metals from asteroids, it's important to remember that even billions of tons of material would be minuscule compared to Earth's total mass.

● Natural processes: Earth already experiences a constant influx of material from space in the form of meteoroids and dust. It's estimated that around 40,000 tons of space dust fall to Earth each year. Information about how much mass the Earth gains each year from space dust is not included in the sources. The potential addition of mass from asteroid mining would likely be small compared to this natural influx.

Therefore, based on the information in the sources and considering the vast difference in scale between Earth's mass and the potential mass of extracted materials, it's highly unlikely that bringing back heavy rare metals from asteroids would have any measurable impact on the weight applied to Earth's surface.

However, it's crucial to acknowledge that this assessment is based on current understanding and projections. The scale and efficiency of future asteroid mining operations are uncertain and could potentially change this assessment in the very long term.
